Provide your `netID` to the MEG scientists for you to have access to the lab booking calendar.


.. warning::

   While scheduling your experiment, avoid rush hours 8:30am and 5:30pm, and friday prayer time, as more noise can be introduced into the data due to outside movement.
   All bookings should not happen on a monday morning, as Helium refill is scheduled for monday mornings (9:00 am till 10:30 am)
   and it is not possible to acquire data during this period.

.. important::

    Scan the QR code below to book your lab for your usage, login with `Gmail` using your `@nyu.edu` account

    If you do not have access to the booking system, please email `hz3752@nyu.edu` to be added to the system.
    Alternatively, schedule your experiment in the MEG lab using link `https://corelabs.abudhabi.nyu.edu/ <https://corelabs.abudhabi.nyu.edu/>`_
    Under Reservations, Schedule, from the upper drop down menu pick `Brain Imaging` and then book the `MagnetoEncephaloGraphy MEG-KIT`
    If you need the MEG scientist (Hadi Zaatiti) to be present during the booking (in the case of a training for example) please first make sure before booking the MEG lab to do the following:

    - ensure that the slot is available on his gmail calendar `hz3752@nyu.edu` (the calendar is kept up to date)
    - send a meeting on google calendar at the requested slot with subject `MEG Training of [name and netID of trainee]`
    - then book the lab at the same slot using the above QR code/link
