Safety Considerations
---------------------

1. **System Users**
    - All simultaneous acquisition of EEG and fMRI is performed within the MRI environment in the presence of a powerful magnetic field (3 Tesla)
    - All MR safety rules prescribed by the MRI radiographers/physicist must be observed at all times
    - All people involved in using the BrainAmp MR plus in an MR environment must an MR authorized person or MR operator or be supervised by the aforementioned
    - Simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisition requires adherence to **MR safety rules**.
    - Only **MR authorized persons** or **MR operators** are permitted to operate the system.

2. **Product Labeling**
    - Equipment labeled **MR unsafe** must not enter the MRI scanner room.
    - Only use **MR conditional** or **MR safe** equipment.

- All components of the MR series of amplifiers carry a label related to their safety properties in the MR environment.

- Equipment that is labeled as **MR unsafe** must not enter the MR scanner room.

- Only use **MR conditional** or **MR safe** equipment in the MR scanner room.

- All the EEG equipment in the MR lab has been labeled appropriately and must be strictly adhered to.


3. **Head Coil for EEG-fMRI**
   - Use the **Siemens Head/Neck 64ch coil** for proper cable routing.

Capping and Impedance Preparation
---------------------------------

Preparation of BrainCap MR
--------------------------

- Perform all preparation **outside the scanner room**.
- The recording computer can be put in the EEG mockup room to prepare participants prior to an experiment
- Required materials:
   - BrainCap MR
   - BrainAmp system, USB2 Adapter
   - Preparation kit (Abralyt gel, cotton swabs, toothbrush, measuring tape, washers, syringes).

Positioning the Cap
-------------------

1. Measure head circumference and choose an appropriately sized cap.
2. Position the cap starting from the **forehead**, ensuring Cz is centered.
3. Adjust electrode positions (Fp1/Fp2 above eyebrows).

   .. figure:: figures/eeg-fmri-operationprotocol/SOP_eeg13.jpg
      :align: center
      :alt: Positioning BrainCap MR

Filling Electrodes
------------------

1. Push hair aside using a cotton swab.
2. Degrease skin with alcohol.



3. Apply Abralyt gel and gently abrade using the cotton swab.
4. Fill the space between skin and electrode with gel using a syringe.

   .. figure:: figures/eeg-fmri-operationprotocol/SOP_eeg14.jpg
      :align: center
      :alt: Filling BrainCap Electrodes

5. Capping: every electrode must be well gelled (we cannot just use the electrodes we need) in an FMRI environment
6. Impedence check
    - After setting up the scanner interfaces, the EEG cap was prepared, and we checked the impedance values of each electrode. Each electrode should be below 50 kOhm for EEG-fMRI recordings.
    - It is recommended to record some data outside of the scanner room. This can be used to check the quality of ECG signal and check for strong R peaks. In this data set, strong R peaks are visible.

Positioning the ECG Electrode
-----------------------------

1. Degrease the skin and attach the ECG holder using adhesive washers.
2. Place the ECG lead along the **paravertebral line**.
3. Ensure the lead is not taut and allows head movement.

Cleaning the BrainCap MR
------------------------

1. Soak the BrainCap MR in lukewarm water for 10 minutes.
2. Gently clean electrodes with a **soft toothbrush**.
3. Use mild agents like baby shampoo if necessary.
4. Rinse thoroughly and remove all cleaning residues.
5. Pat dry using a clean towel and allow to air dry on a rack or dummy head.

EEG/fMRI system settings
------------------------

At NYUAD, the Siemens trigger box from the scanner is on `Toggle Mode`.

The Recorder software settings on the EEG data acquisition computer is set to match the Siemens setup.
In Recorder under Amplifier â†’ Digital Port Settings set enable Bit15 and check both active
The file BP_Onboarding_initial_test_toggle_24-09-2024.eeg was recorded with this trigger configuration. It results in T_on then T_off marker pattern for every TR.

This setting, will show T 1_off and T 1_on where the time difference between two consecutive ones corresponds to the TR.
The default setting on BrainProducts is to have an R128 every TR, but this will not be the case for the setup at NYUAD.

Data acquisition process
------------------------


The protocol describes the data acquisition process.


Activation of the product
-------------------------

- The NYUAD MRI lab owns one permanent licenses for each of the three software BrainVision Recorder, BrainVision Recview and BrainVision Analyzer.
- The licenses are on USB dongles, ensure that the USB dongles are plugged in into the recorder or analysis laptop


Software stack
--------------

- BrainVision Recorder: data acquisition software that connects to the amplifiers and cap
- BrainVision RecView: NA
- BrainVision Analyzer: post-processing software for artifact removal, filtering and so on


Typical EEG-fMRI dataset structure
----------------------------------

- An .eeg file: raw data from the electrodes.
- A .vhdr or .xhdr file: a header containing metadata on parameters and sensors.
- A .xmrk file: contains markers with their time (can be opened in a text file).

Example of such datasets are present on NYU-BOX.
Demo dataset has been provided by BP and are available on the recording computer:

- In the S1-EEGfMRI dataset, at some point in time we can see the gradient artifacts
- Some EEG-fMRI jargon: history is the sequence of analysis steps and each step is a node
- BrainVision Analyser is used to perform analysis of the data after acquisition


External environment noise
--------------------------

Static field recording is important to allow removing the magnet noise
(even when we are not using fmri) ideally we record first a lot of static field data
until we understand the artifacts, then for each experiment we record atleast 1minute
of static field data for the movement artifacts.

- Collect EEG data in a static field to identify artifacts and remove them in post-processing
- This involves collecting EEG data while the participant is in the scanner but not doing any task


Data acquisition protocol
-------------------------

- `T1` image of participant is needed (if source reconstruction will be performed)


- Setup your experiment on the `MRI stimulus computer` to land on the `Introduction Page` of yoru experiment
- Setup `BrainVision Recorder`
    - Open the BrainVision recorder software in administrative mode
    - File -> Open Workspace, choose a workspace [TODO: Add name of default workspace here]



Outside scanner data acquisition and ECG sanity check
-----------------------------------------------------

After the subject is gelled, impedence are checked and before they enter the MRI scanner room, ensure that:
Each electrode should be below 50 kOhm for EEG-fMRI recordings.

- Data must be recorded outside the scanner room to check for the quality of the ECG signal.
- Check for strong R peaks. In this data set, strong R peaks are visible.

    .. figure:: figures/eeg-fmri-operationprotocol/SOP_eeg20.png
        :align: center

    Strong R peaks on ECG electrode can be visualised as a sanity check before entering the MRI scanner room.

- Experimental data can also be collected outside of the scanner for sanity checks
- To summarise, using the EEG-fMRI system data can be collected:
    - outside of the MRI scanner room
    - in the static field
    - during the fMRI session
    - This data can be used to compare the signal to noise ratio across different testing conditions

Static Field data acquisition
-----------------------------

- Prior to activating the fMRI gradient coils, make sure to collect a duration (ideally 2 minutes) of the static field
- The static field data will be used for artifact correction in the processing pipelines







Helium Pump Noise:
------------------
- Components around the 50Hz frequency should appear in all channels.
- The helium pumps cannot be turned off during an experiment.

Ventilation System:
-------------------

- Usually causes a higher peak at 50Hz in FFT, with more spread-out noise across high-frequency components.

Markers and Timing Verification:
--------------------------------

The marker verification allows us to see if any TR's are not being marked correctly

- **Marker Verification** needs to be downloaded separately to the BP software
- If max and min in marker verification are very far apart, it means a marker is missing



Gradient Artifact:
------------------

- Occurs during fMRI data acquisition (while acquiring volume).
- In Analyzer, use **average artifact subtraction** to remove the gradient artifact.
-	First we need to check that the EEG data is synchronized with the scanner clock (Sync On is the MRI scanner clock sync signal)
-	We need to have the R128 markers (T1 volume markers)
-	Gradient artifacts changes with channels


Movement and gradient artifact:
-------------------------------

-	Gradient artifacts will change with the movement
-	We use the sliding average to account for movement artifacts
-	Stimuli shouldnâ€™t match the time markers


Below is an example of gradient artifacts

Testing and debugging
---------------------

Simulated amplifier environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A simulated environment can be used to perform tests and debugging.

In BP Recorder:

- Go to configuration, then select amplifier then select simulated amplifier
- Create a new workspace and select data to be played back


To choose a simulated environment for EEG signals

- Configuration -> Select Amplifier -> Simulated Amplifier
- Then Test Signal, This should show you sinusoidal test signals
