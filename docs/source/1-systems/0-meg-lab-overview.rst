The **NeuroWaves Lab** specializes in measuring neural activity using **MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG)** to detect magnetic fields generated by neural currents and **electroencephalography (EEG)** to record electrical brain activity.
This lab provides insights into **neural dynamics, sensory processing, and cognitive research applications**.


MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG)
----------------------------
**MEG systems** measure the magnetic field generated by the brain with **very high temporal resolution**.
They are **non-invasive**, much like a microphone listening to your voice; MEG listens to the brain’s magnetic signals.

Unlike **MRI**, MEG does **not** provide anatomical brain structure visualization.
Thus, **MRI scans** are combined with MEG data to **localize** brain activity.

Main Equipment
--------------
- **Kanazawa Institute of Technology (KIT) MEG System**
  208 axial gradiometers for **high spatio-temporal resolution** recording of local neural activity.
- **OPM MEG by Fieldline**
  64-channel system.
- **EEG System by Brain Products**
  32/64-channel system for **high-resolution** recording of brain electrical activity.

Supporting Equipment
--------------------
- **FastSCAN Laser Scanner**
  Precise anatomical mapping and source localization.
- **Eye Link 1000 Eye Tracking System**
  Synchronized gaze tracking.
- **Vpixx Projector System**
  Sensory stimulation and response recording.
- **ResponsePixx 5-button fiber-optic Response Box**
  Motor response synchronization.



Magnetically Shielded Room (MSR)
--------------------------------
A **Magnetically Shielded Room (MSR)** is required to isolate sensors from external magnetic fields and noise sources.

The **NYUAD MEG Lab** is equipped with an **MSR from Vacuumschmelze (Hanau, Germany)**.
The shielding effect is provided by:
- **Two layers of mu-metal shielding**
  - Inner layer: **3 mm thick**
  - Outer layer: **2 mm thick**
- **Predicted shielding performance**: -60 dB at 1 Hz
- **Actual shielding performance**: **Exceeds prediction**

Room dimensions:
- **Exterior**: **2.9 × 3.5 × 2.9 m**
- **Interior**: **2.4 × 3.0 × 2.4 m**
