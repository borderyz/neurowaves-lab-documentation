MEG Data storage
################

The MEG data is securely stored on NYU BOX, access is given through invitations.
The *Data* folder is structured in the **BIDS** standardized format.
Please raise an issue on *github* repository if you think the structure does not conform to **BIDS**.

MRI Data storage
################

MRI data is hosted on Flywheel

Data naming and uploading protocol
----------------------------------

In the following, [SUB_ID] should be replaced with the ID of the subject for naming purposes.
The different data files generated from a MEG experiment are the following.

.. note::
    If you have suggestions to make the naming convention better, please raise an issue on github
    or create a pull request with your proposed modifications.

Laser scan files
################

#. A .fsn filename that should be named ``sub-\[SUB_ID\]_scan.fsn`` : This file is obtained by saving
   the whole fastscan laser project (File Save)

#. Several .txt
    * ``sub-[SUB_ID]_scan.txt``  is the head scan of the participant
    * ``sub-[SUB_ID]_scan_stylus.txt`` is the stylus location file of the participant

KIT-MEG files
#############

Depending on the experiment, many .con files can be produced by the KIT machine.

#. .con files are named:
   * ``sub-[SUB_ID]_ses-[date]_meg.con`` where [data] is in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`

#. .mrk files are named:
   * ``sub-[SUB_ID]_[marker_number]_ses-[date]_meg.mrk`` where [marker_number] is replaced with the number of the marker (representing the time-order of acquisition of that marker) and [data] is in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`

OPM files
#########

The OPM system generates a BIDS directory with the .fif files

#. The generated .fif files are named:
   * ``sub-[SUB_ID]_ses-[date]_meg_raw.fif``  where [data] is in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`


Data uploading
##############

Data will be uploaded to NYU BOX, to the following link

.. admonition:: Link to MEG data (Box Invitation Only)

    `https://nyu.box.com/v/meg-datafiles <https://nyu.box.com/v/meg-datafiles>`_

Steps

#. Access the folder of NYU Box
#. Identify the project that the data belongs to
#. Access the folder for that project or create a new folder if non-existent

#. Follow the BIDS structure format, within each project file, we find subjects file named by their ID
    * Within each subjects folder we find, *anat*, *meg-kit*, *meg-opm* folders
    * Place the corresponding files into the right folder: all headscan files go to *anat*, the .con and .mrk goes to *meg-kit*, the .fif goes to *meg-opm*
#. The subject ID must be added to the Excel sheet on `Participant_ID_Generator.csv` in the NYU BOX `MEG/DATA` folder. You have two options here, either name the subjects by adding an index number starting from the last one available in the Excel sheet, or use your own numbering followed by a `-[name of your project]`


#. Make sure that all files have been uploaded to the folder
