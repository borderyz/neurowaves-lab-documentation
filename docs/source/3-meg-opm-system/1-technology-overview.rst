Technology Overview

Optically Pumped Magnetometer (OPM) MEG technology represents a significant advancement in magnetoencephalography,
offering enhanced flexibility and precision in measuring brain activity. Unlike traditional SQUID-based MEG systems,
which require cryogenic cooling and fixed helmet-like sensors, OPM sensors operate at room temperature and can be
mounted directly onto the scalp. This enables more naturalistic brain recordings, especially beneficial in
studies involving children or tasks that involve movement. OPMs provide high spatial and temporal resolution,
making them suitable for dynamic, real-world neuroscience applications. Their portability and adaptability
are paving the way for broader clinical and research use in cognitive neuroscience, neurodevelopment,
and brain-computer interfaces.
