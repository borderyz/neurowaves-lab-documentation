Main Applications
-----------------

OPM MEG systems are used to study brain activity in a safe and
non-invasive way. Unlike SQUID-based MEG systems, OPM sensors can
be placed directly on the head, reducing the sensor-to-scalp distance, and move with the person,
making them more comfortable. The OPM system helmet holds the sensor slots.
The sensors can be moved form one slot to another, allowing to have a higher number of sensors in a region and less in another region.

OPM MEG is used in brain research to study things like language, memory,
and attention, and in hospitals to help plan surgeries for conditions
like epilepsy or brain tumors. Because the system is portable and more
adaptable, it can be used in more places than older MEG machines.
