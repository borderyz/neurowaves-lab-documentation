Main Applications
-----------------

OPM MEG systems are used to study brain activity in a safe and
non-invasive way. Unlike traditional MEG systems, OPM sensors can
be placed directly on the head and move with the person,
making them more comfortable and flexible. This is especially helpful
for scanning children or people who have trouble staying still.
OPM MEG is used in brain research to study things like language, memory,
and attention, and in hospitals to help plan surgeries for conditions
like epilepsy or brain tumors. Because the system is portable and more
adaptable, it can be used in more places than older MEG machines.
