SQUID-Based MEG - Main Applications
===================================

SQUID-based MEG has a wide range of applications in both clinical and research settings due to its ability to capture rapid
neural dynamics with high fidelity. Clinically, it is especially valuable in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy, helping
to localize seizure foci with high temporal and spatial precision. It is also used in mapping functional brain areas responsible
for language, motor, and sensory processing, which is crucial in neurosurgical planning.

In research, SQUID-MEG supports investigations into cognitive processes such as attention, memory, perception, and decision-making.
Its non-invasive nature and millisecond temporal resolution make it ideal for studying real-time neural oscillations and connectivity
in healthy individuals and patient populations, contributing to the understanding of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.
