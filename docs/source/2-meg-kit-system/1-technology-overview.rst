SQUID-based MEG - Technology Overview
=====================================

Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)-based magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a non-invasive neuroimaging
technology that measures the brain’s magnetic fields with exceptional temporal precision. SQUIDs operate at cryogenic
temperatures—typically cooled using liquid helium—to achieve superconductivity, enabling them to detect femtotesla-level
magnetic signals generated by neuronal current flows.

Housed within a rigid dewar, SQUID arrays are positioned close to the scalp but not in direct contact, allowing whole-head
recordings from hundreds of channels simultaneously. The system provides high temporal resolution (on the order of milliseconds)
and good spatial resolution, making it ideal for studying dynamic brain processes such as sensory responses, cognition, and epilepsy.

While SQUID-based MEG is considered the gold standard in functional brain mapping, its reliance on bulky, fixed cryogenic
infrastructure limits portability and demands specialized shielded environments to reduce environmental noise.
