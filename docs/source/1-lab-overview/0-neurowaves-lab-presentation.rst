The **NeuroWaves Lab** (NW Lab), established in March 2024 at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) is a state-of-the-art research
facility dedicated to advance brain research. The lab provides systems, equipments and processes enabling measurement and analysis of neural activity using **MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG)** to detect magnetic fields generated by neural currents and **electroencephalography (EEG)** to record electrical brain activity.
The lab provides insights into **neural dynamics, sensory processing, and cognitive research applications**.



MagnetoEncephaloGraphy (MEG)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**MEG systems** measure the magnetic field generated by the brain with **very high temporal resolution** and **non-invasively**.

Unlike **MRI**, MEG does **not** provide anatomical brain structure visualization.
Thus, **MRI scans** are combined with MEG data to **localize** brain activity and visualise it on the brain.

Main Equipment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Kanazawa Institute of Technology (KIT) MEG System**
  208 axial gradiometers for **high spatio-temporal resolution** recording of local neural activity.
- **OPM MEG by Fieldline**
  96-channel system.
- **EEG System by Brain Products**
  32/64-channel system for **high-resolution** recording of brain electrical activity.

Supporting Equipment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **FastSCAN Laser Scanner**
  Precise anatomical mapping and headscan digitization.
- **Eye Link 1000 Eye Tracking System**
  Synchronized gaze tracking.
- **Vpixx Projector System**
  Sensory stimulation and response recording.
- **ResponsePixx 5-button fiber-optic Response Box**
  Motor response synchronization.
- **Magnetically Shielded Room (MSR)** is required to isolate sensors from external magnetic fields and noise sources.
