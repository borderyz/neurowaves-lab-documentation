# Trigger Dictionary

We use 8 trigger types:

Mapping from binary code to trigger type name (P_sound start,...)
Channels from 224 to 231 
 [00000000]
[10000000] --> P_sound start
[01000000] --> P_sound end


- Binary Code (8 bits) x Trigger type name








# Button presses 

5 buttons on the left hand
and 3 buttons for the right hand

- add more details here: are we listening to any  button press and saving the first pressed button into the logfile
- or are we listening to a specific button(s) and if the user presses something else, nothing happens?
- does the button listening is timed? above a certain time we pass the trial or do we keep listening indefinitely to the button press


# Operational Protocol

What each file is, and what we need to run, what are the input values (subject ID, ...)
What is the output of your experiment (files output)
